# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "Fixed the issue where validation failures resulted in minimal HTML placeholders. Now uses proper context-aware fallback templates (_create_video_platform_fallback for video platforms, _create_generic_fallback for other sites). Added better logging to track generation process. Changes: 1) Replaced minimal structure with fallback template calls, 2) Enhanced _create_generic_fallback with a complete landing page template, 3) Added logging for extraction and fallback usage."

        comment: "COMPREHENSIVE FIX APPLIED - Root cause addressed. Changes: 1) Added extensive logging throughout generation pipeline to track AI responses and extraction, 2) Improved code extraction with multiple fallback methods (standard markdown, generic code blocks, regex patterns), 3) Made validation more lenient - focuses on HTML structure (doctype, head, body) rather than arbitrary character counts, 4) Enhanced extraction methods to handle various AI response formats, 5) Fallbacks now only trigger for complete failures (HTML < 100 chars) instead of premature triggering. The system should now properly use AI-generated code instead of falling back to static templates."

        comment: "CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: AI generation is completely failing due to budget exceeded error (Current cost: 11.097285250000002, Max budget: 9.0). All three test prompts (YouTube clone, recipe blog, e-commerce dashboard) generate identical HTML (15907 chars) using the VideoTube fallback template. The repetitive layouts issue persists because: 1) AI service budget is exhausted, 2) All requests fall back to the same video platform template regardless of prompt, 3) Generation times are suspiciously fast (0.06-0.51s) indicating no AI processing. Backend logs show: 'Budget has been exceeded! Current cost: 11.097285250000002, Max budget: 9.0' and 'Failed to generate chat completion'. The fix implemented by main agent works correctly, but the underlying AI service is non-functional due to budget constraints."

    message: "I've identified and fixed the root cause: When AI generation failed validation checks (HTML too short or missing styles), the system was creating a minimal placeholder HTML ('Generation in progress...') instead of using the proper fallback templates. Now it properly uses context-aware fallbacks. Testing needed: Generate 3-4 different websites (e.g., 'YouTube clone', 'recipe blog', 'portfolio site', 'dashboard') and verify each produces unique, complete layouts."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "MAJOR UPDATE: Implemented comprehensive fix for repetitive layouts. The real issue was: 1) Validation was too strict (500 char minimum, required <style> tags), causing premature fallback triggering, 2) Code extraction was too basic and failed on various AI response formats, 3) Fallbacks were triggering too early. FIX: Made validation structure-based (checks for doctype, head, body) instead of size-based, improved extraction with multiple methods, added extensive logging to track the entire generation pipeline. Fallbacks now ONLY trigger if generation completely fails (< 100 chars). Ready for testing with diverse prompts. Check backend logs during generation to verify AI code is being used."

    message: "CRITICAL FINDING: The repetitive layouts issue is NOT fixed. Root cause is AI service budget exhaustion (cost: $11.10, limit: $9.00). All website generation requests fail at the AI level and fall back to the same VideoTube template, regardless of prompt. Tested 3 specific prompts: 1) YouTube clone → VideoTube template (15907 chars), 2) Recipe blog → VideoTube template (15907 chars), 3) E-commerce dashboard → VideoTube template (15907 chars). The main agent's code fixes are correct, but the AI service is non-functional. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Either increase AI service budget or implement proper prompt-specific fallback templates that match the user's request (recipe blog should get recipe template, dashboard should get dashboard template, not video template)."
